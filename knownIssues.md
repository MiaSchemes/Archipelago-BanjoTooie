# Known Issues

- You can use moves that weren't sent to you by standing on a silo or in a loading zone. This can break logic in some places.
- Occasionally items will not send. Usually fixed by restarting the connector and game. No known cause, so please give us data if it happens.
- Collectibles count will tick up when re-obtaining an item that already sent a check, such as on a clean save file.
