# Known Issues

# Fixed and waiting to push
- Pig Pool requirements: Access to both CCL and HFP 
- JRL Doubloons: should hard require split up (I or'ed when I should have and'ed)
- Power Hut Basement: should require split up or fire eggs
- Move silos: Note requirements currently not accounted for.
- Weldar: Should require Bill Drill and Grenade Eggs
- Stomping Plains: Both jiggies in the TDL region, require Ice Eggs/Springy Step
- More places where explosives are needed can expect clockworks
- Ice Train: Snowball is needed to press the train switch
- HFP Kickball Stadium: Mumbo's wand can break the breakable walls
- Smuggler's Cavern: Should require explosives

# Not yet fixed
- Jinjo Families: Jinjo patterns make checking ability requirements impossible in current implementation. Will be fixed in the future.
- Saving Roysten only gives bubbles, not fast swim
- You can use moves that weren't sent to you by standing on a silo or in a loading zone. This can break logic in some places.
